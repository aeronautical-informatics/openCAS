//! Cas_rs has been created by DLR FT-SSY-AES. It is an updated rust version of previous work done by Stanford Intelligent Systems Laboratory (SISL).
//! SISL has created neural network projects called `VerticalCAS` and `HorizontalCAS`. These systems represent the behaviour of the
//! Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS) which is currently in development to replace TCAS. For more details on SISL work please go
//! [here](https://github.com/sisl/HorizontalCAS).
//! This project currently focuses to use the done work on embedded systems in safety critical environments. Therefore, the orginal code made in
//! Python and Julia is not sufficient.
//! Currently the project only implements the code of HorizontalCAS. The implementation of VerticalCAS is coming soon.
